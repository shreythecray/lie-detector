## Introduction

We will be building a serverless application that uses Artificial Intelligence to conduct facial recognition and send alerts to you.
We just launched our first hackathon, and are giving away over $1K in prizes! Join us in building a cool project and winning any of the following prizes 🏆
* **Courier Hacks 1st Place:** Top submission for use for notifications and demonstration of proper app-to-user notifications with the Courier API will receive $1000 via Zelle or PayPal.
* **Courier Hacks 2nd Place:** 2nd Place submission for use for notifications and demonstration of proper app-to-user notifications with the Courier API will receive the Apple AirPods Pro.
* **Public Favorite:** Public favorite winner will receive a Keychron Keyboard.
* **Runners-Up:** Runners-up submissions will receive a Hydro Flask.

Additionally, everyone who submits a project successfully integrating the Courier API will receive a $20 Amazon gift card!

Not sure where to start? In this tutorial, we will be building a Serverless lie detector that uses Artificial IntelligenceI for Facial Recognition.

## What’s going on?

Let’s get started. Headquarters is telling us that we have been betrayed and one of our spies has been leaking sensitive, top secret information to our enemies. As secret agents, our goal is to build a lie detector that will alert our spy network when we identify the mole. We will use Azure’s Cognitive Services to conduct facial recognition on everyone within our team and when the Face API recognizes that one of our spies is being deceitful, we will use Courier to broadcast the identity of the mole to our spy network.

Some spies prefer reading emails and others prefer reading texts, so we need to make sure that our app can accommodate all spy preferences.

**Note:** The first 3 Secret Agents to successfully complete this tutorial and task will receive a top secret gift from HQ via Courier.

In Part 1, we will create our serverless application using Azure Functions. In Part 2, we will first integrate the Gmail and Twilio APIs, which Courier will use to send emails and text messages. In Part 3, we will demonstrate how to send single messages and setup routing to send multi-channel notifications from the Azure function. And finally, in Part 4, we will explore Azure Cognitive Services and integrate the Face API to analyze emotions and use the Courier API to send alerts when specific deceiving emotions are detected.

Our hackathon has started and submissions close on September 28th. Register now to submit this project for a chance to win some cool prizes.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Create serverless application using Azure Functions

### Part 2: Authorize Courier to send messages using Gmail and Twilio APIs

### Part 3: Send single and multi-channel notifications from the Azure function

### Part 4: Analyze emotions with the Face API send alerts with Courier

## Conclusion

Our spies are now ready to receive their secret encoded messages. Try testing the lie detector on yourself or your fellow spies and alert `courier.demos+liedetector@gmail.com`, and we will send a gift to the first 3 Secret Agents who complete this task! Don’t forget to submit your project to our [Hackathon](https://courier-hacks.devpost.com/) for a chance to win over $1000 in cash and prizes!
